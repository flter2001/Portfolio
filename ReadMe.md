Hello World.
This will be the base for my portfolio and also my personal cheatSheet.
My motivation behind creating this was a recquisite in the Codecdemy Front-End-Develeper course, it would aslo be good to have a personal cheatSheet that I can come back to!
I have built a simple webpage that holds my About-me Projects and CheatSheet Material(not as of now)!
I have learnt many things in this project like flexbook, CSS Attribute and more, later will be making tables.
